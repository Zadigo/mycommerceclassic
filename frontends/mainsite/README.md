## Configuring the service

1. Enter the [frontends/mainsite](./frontends/mainsite/nuxt.config.ts) directory and run `pnpm run dev`or you can also run `pnpm run dev:mainsite` at the root the folder (with pnpm workspace)
2. Ensure you have a Stripe account for working/testing the cart payment process in development mode
3. You also need an active Google Account in order to create the relevant keys for Google Authentication
4. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder with all the relevant keys provided in the respective `.env.example` file present in each project
5. You also need to create a Google Analytics, Facebook Pixels and Microsoft Clarity account in order to use all the tracking possibilities offered within the template
6. You might also want to create a Firebase account in order to use the Firebase features such as authentication, storage, and real-time database
7. Finally, you can use the `nuxt.config.js` file to configure the template to your needs

The Nuxt application also comes with basic fixtures that can be used to test the application out of the box. They are located in [server/utils/testing](./frontends/mainsite/server/utils/testing/index.ts)  and can be used to simulate server API calls.

> [!NOTE]
> The Nuxt application is designed using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern, which means that the frontend communicates with the backend through a dedicated API layer. This allows for better separation of concerns and easier maintenance of the codebase.
